#' Cyclomort: a package for parameteric periodic survival modeling
#' 
#' @details Functions in this package allow the user to fit right-censored mortality data to a parametric model that is periodic. We use maximum likelihood estimation to produce esimates for the peaks in mortality over the course of the year as well as the strength or condensation of mortality around these peak indices. We also include a function that simulates a random set of mortalities given a set of parameters, allowing one to test the accuracy of their fits.
