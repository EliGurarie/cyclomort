Description: This package provides tools for estimating periodic hazard functions from right-censored time-to-event (e.g. mortality) data, as well as functions for simulation of periodic mortality processes, visualization of fits, and a priori hypothesis testing tools.  The package was inspired by the need to detect annual seasonal patterns in mortality of wildlife, thus, the central assumption is that the period itself is known (e.g. 1 year, 24 hours, etc.), but the number, intensity and duration of the peaks of increased hazard are unknown.
