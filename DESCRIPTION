Description: This package can be used to fit survival curves to mortality data when the mortality rates may vary periodically over the course of a year. Migratory animals and even humans (more susceptible to many disesases during the winter) may exhibit a periodic mortality curve. Here we use a modified version of the Cauchy distribution to produce fits for mortality data when this periodicity may exist.
