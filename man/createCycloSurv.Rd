\title{Create an object that can be fitted with a given period from survival (time of death or censoring) data}
\usage{
createCycloSurv(start, end, event, data = NULL, t0 = NULL, period,
  timeunits = "days")
}
\arguments{
\item{start}{a vector measuring time of birth (as a POSIXct, numeric, or Date)}

\item{end}{a vector measuring time of death or censoring (as a POSIXct, numeric, or Date)}

\item{event}{a vector of booleans (0 = alive, 1 = dead) detailing the status of the observation}

\item{data}{data.frame object containing start, end and event data}

\item{t0}{reference time for event times.  By default, \code{t0} is set to January 1 of the first year of observations (if times are POSIX).}

\item{period}{length of one period in the input data}

\item{timeunits}{units that dates are inputted in if dates are being used}
}
\value{
a Surv object with an attribute "period" that reads the period.
}
